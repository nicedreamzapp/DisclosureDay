The truth is coming. On June 12, 2026, Steven Spielberg returns to the genre he helped define with **Disclosure Day** — a UFO film that promises to be unlike anything we've seen before.

## The Basics

**Disclosure Day** is an upcoming American science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg, marking his first feature since the semi-autobiographical *The Fabelmans* (2022). The film is produced by Amblin Entertainment and will be distributed by Universal Pictures.

**Release Date:** June 12, 2026 (Theatrical & IMAX)

## The Story

While plot details remain classified, the film's logline reveals the central question:

> *"If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you? This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people."*

The teaser trailer shows Emily Blunt as a meteorologist whose live broadcast is interrupted by something otherworldly. Josh O'Connor plays a UFO whistleblower determined to share the truth with the world.

This isn't an invasion film. It's a *revelation* film.

## The Creators

### Steven Spielberg — Director & Story
This is Spielberg's **37th feature film** and his return to UFO cinema after a 20-year gap since *War of the Worlds* (2005). The story originated from his own treatment — 40-50 pages that he developed before bringing in David Koepp.

### David Koepp — Screenwriter
Koepp's Spielberg collaborations include some of cinema's biggest hits:
- Jurassic Park (1993)
- The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)
- War of the Worlds (2005)
- Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)

He's called *Disclosure Day* "deeply emotional."

### Kristie Macosko Krieger — Producer
Five-time Academy Award nominee. She's been Spielberg's producing partner for **27 years**, working on:
- The Fabelmans
- West Side Story
- Ready Player One
- The Post
- Bridge of Spies

### Janusz Kamiński — Cinematographer
Two-time Oscar winner (*Schindler's List*, *Saving Private Ryan*). He's shot every Spielberg film since 1993.

### John Williams — Composer
At 93 years old, Williams came out of retirement for this film. It marks his **30th collaboration** with Spielberg. His alien film scores include the iconic five-note motif from *Close Encounters* and the emotional heart of *E.T.*

## Production Details

- **Filming began:** February 26, 2025
- **Locations:** New Jersey, Atlanta, New York City, Huntington
- **Working title:** "Non-View"
- **Wrapped:** Late May 2025

Spielberg returned to New Jersey to film — the same state where, as a child, his father woke him up to watch the Perseid meteor shower. That moment sparked a lifelong UFO fascination.

## Spielberg's UFO Legacy

*Disclosure Day* continues a thread that runs through Spielberg's entire career:

| Year | Film | Theme |
|------|------|-------|
| 1964 | Firelight | Amateur UFO film at age 17 |
| 1977 | Close Encounters of the Third Kind | Wonder, first contact |
| 1982 | E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial | Friendship, loss |
| 2005 | War of the Worlds | Invasion, survival |
| 2026 | Disclosure Day | Revelation, truth |

Each film asks a different question about our relationship with the unknown. *Disclosure Day* seems to ask: **What happens when the truth can't be hidden anymore?**

---

## What's Different This Time

Josh O'Connor told press that *Disclosure Day* is "old-school Spielberg" — a return to emotional, character-driven sci-fi rather than pure spectacle. David Koepp emphasized the film is "deeply emotional."

This suggests *Disclosure Day* may be closer in spirit to *Close Encounters* or *E.T.* than *War of the Worlds*.

---

## The Title

"Disclosure" is a loaded term in UFO culture. It refers to the theoretical moment when governments reveal the truth about extraterrestrial contact. In recent years, real-world UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) congressional hearings have brought "disclosure" into mainstream conversation.

Spielberg's timing is impeccable.

## The Bottom Line

Steven Spielberg invented the modern UFO film. At 79 years old, he's returning to ask new questions about first contact, truth, and what it means to share this planet.

June 12, 2026. The truth belongs to seven billion people.

And to us.
