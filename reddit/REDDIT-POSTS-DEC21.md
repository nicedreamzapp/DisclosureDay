## POST 1: For r/movies

**Title:** Josh O'Connor says Disclosure Day is "like old-school Spielberg... Close Encounters, E.T.; that world"

**Body:**
```
In a recent interview, Josh O'Connor (The Crown, Challengers) gave the clearest description yet of what to expect from Spielberg's upcoming UFO film Disclosure Day:

> "Like old-school Spielberg. I think people will be excited... 'Close Encounters,' 'E.T.'; that world."

O'Connor plays a whistleblower trying to reveal the truth about alien life. In the trailer, his character says: "People have a right to know the truth. It belongs to 7 billion people."

Emily Blunt also recently called Spielberg her "movie dad" on The Awardist podcast, saying "It was very goose-bumpy when he called."

Both actors were offered their roles without auditions.

**What we know:**
- Steven Spielberg directing from his own original story
- David Koepp wrote the screenplay
- John Williams scoring at age 93 (his 30th Spielberg collaboration)
- Filmed in NJ, Atlanta, and NYC under the title "Non-View"
- June 12, 2026 release in IMAX

## POST 2: For r/UFOs

**Title:** Spielberg's "Disclosure Day" — whistleblower character says "the truth belongs to 7 billion people"

**Body:**
```
The timing of this film is fascinating.

Steven Spielberg's new UFO movie "Disclosure Day" drops June 2026 — right as real-world UAP disclosure is reaching critical mass.

From the trailer, Josh O'Connor plays a whistleblower trying to reveal the truth. His line: **"People have a right to know the truth. It belongs to 7 billion people."**

Sound familiar?

O'Connor described the film as "like old-school Spielberg... Close Encounters, E.T.; that world." Not War of the Worlds invasion stuff — the wonder and contact stuff.

Some interesting facts:
- Spielberg wrote the original story treatment himself (40-50 pages)
- The film was shot under the code name "Non-View"
- John Williams came out of retirement at 93 to score it
- Spielberg has said in interviews: "I don't believe we're alone in the universe. I think it's mathematically impossible."

Whether this is pure fiction or timed for something bigger... the cultural moment feels intentional.

## POST 3: For r/Spielberg

**Title:** Emily Blunt calls Spielberg her "movie dad" — reveals he personally called to offer her Disclosure Day role

**Body:**
```
On The Awardist podcast (November 2025), Emily Blunt shared how she got the lead in Disclosure Day:

> "It was very goose-bumpy when he called. He kind of just said, 'We want you to play this part.'"

She also called him her "movie dad."

Like Josh O'Connor, Blunt was offered the role without an audition. Spielberg knew exactly who he wanted.

This feels like vintage Spielberg casting — picking actors he trusts to carry emotional weight rather than just screen-testing everyone.

Combined with John Williams returning at 93 and Janusz Kamiński behind the camera, this is the full classic Spielberg team assembled for what might be his definitive UFO statement.

## POST 4: For r/movies (alternative angle)

**Title:** John Williams came out of retirement at 93 for Spielberg's "Disclosure Day" — his 30th collaboration with the director

**Body:**
```
John Williams said he was done composing for films.

Then Steven Spielberg called about Disclosure Day.

This will be their **30th collaboration** spanning 50 years:
- Jaws (1975)
- Close Encounters (1977)
- E.T. (1982)
- Jurassic Park (1993)
- Schindler's List (1993)
- Saving Private Ryan (1998)
- And 24 more...

Williams' previous alien film scores gave us the iconic five-note motif from Close Encounters and one of cinema's most emotional scores for E.T.

At 93, he's returning to alien territory one more time. Whatever Spielberg showed him was enough to bring him back.

Disclosure Day releases June 12, 2026.
