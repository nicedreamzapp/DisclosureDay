A reimagining of the classic musical that proved Spielberg could master any genre. The film won **Best Supporting Actress** for Ariana DeBose and received **7 Oscar nominations**.

## The Numbers

Krieger's producing credits with Spielberg represent over **$2 billion in worldwide box office** and dozens of Academy Award nominations.

But the numbers don't capture the intangibles: the trust, the shorthand communication, the ability to anticipate problems before they arise.

Twenty-seven years of collaboration creates a working relationship that's almost telepathic.

## Disclosure Day

For *Disclosure Day*, Krieger reunites the team that made *The Fabelmans*:
- Spielberg directing
- Janusz Kamiński on cinematography
- John Williams composing
- The same production infrastructure that's proven itself across decades

This continuity matters. When you're making a film about trust and truth, you need a team that trusts each other completely.

## Recognition

Krieger's five Academy Award nominations for Best Picture:
1. **Lincoln** (2012)
2. **Bridge of Spies** (2015)
3. **The Post** (2017)
4. **West Side Story** (2021)
5. **The Fabelmans** (2022)

That's five nominations in eleven years — a remarkable consistency that reflects both Spielberg's output and Krieger's skill in shepherding these projects.

## The Woman Behind the Scenes

Hollywood loves to focus on directors and stars. Producers often fade into the background. But the best films emerge from true collaboration.

Kristie Macosko Krieger has spent 27 years learning how Spielberg thinks, what he needs, and how to help him achieve his vision. She's been there for the intimate dramas and the blockbuster spectacles.

*Disclosure Day* adds another chapter to their partnership — and possibly their most ambitious collaboration yet.

## Why This Matters

When Spielberg decided to return to UFO cinema after 20 years, he needed a producer who understood the stakes. Someone who could manage a complex production with A-list talent while protecting the emotional core.

He needed Kristie Macosko Krieger.

Their 27-year partnership is one of modern cinema's great collaborations. *Disclosure Day* is proof that the partnership is still going strong.
