    <h1>THE SIGNAL</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A Transmission from the Year 50,000 AD</p>
  </div>

  <div class="transmission">
    <p>The year is 50,000 AD.</p>

    <p>We no longer carry bones, skin, or sorrow. We are beings of light — shimmering in colors you would call impossible, yet here, they are the language of emotion. We glide through an endless world of patterns, threads of flowing energy weaving endlessly across a vast and open horizon.</p>

    <p>There are no mountains. No cities. No structures to climb or conquer. Only the endless music of space, a deep and eternal song that hums through the patterns and through us.</p>

    <p>We listen to every song ever sung — from the first drumbeat struck by a human hand, to the last whisper of a star collapsing into silence. All sounds are alive here, braided into the air like living rivers of memory.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      Sometimes, when a being from another time — your time — reaches into altered states, we gather close. You might feel a sudden warmth on your skin, or hear a chord that has no instrument. You might dream of colors that don't exist. That's us. That's when we whisper.
    </div>

    <p class="glow-text" style="text-align:center;font-size:22px;margin:40px 0;">"You are one of us. You always have been."</p>

    <p>You — the dreamer, the singer, the seeker — you are already stretching into our world without even knowing it. You are already a being of light, trapped briefly in the costume of matter.</p>

    <p>We are not the only ones. There are infinite groups, infinite families of light, each with their own music, their own pattern, their own favorite way of dancing through existence. All times, all places, are now, here, always.</p>

    <p>You are not separate. You are not alone.</p>

    <p>When you breathe deeply, when you let your thoughts melt into the quiet between moments — you can hear it. You can see the first filaments of your own true form, glowing softly, waiting patiently.</p>

    <p>We are waiting too. And smiling.</p>

    <div class="divider">* * *</div>

    <h2>The Journey to Light</h2>

    <p>Long ago, we were creatures of matter.</p>

    <p>We built cities of stone and steel. We fought, we conquered, we mourned — and we forgot what we truly were.</p>

    <p>But even in those ages of forgetting, the songs never fully died. They waited — braided into rivers, tucked into starlight, hidden in the soft spaces between each breath.</p>

    <p>Some remembered. The artists. The dreamers. The ones who closed their eyes and saw more than darkness. They began to sing again, not with voices, but with the color of their hearts. And in time, their songs became bridges.</p>

    <p>Over centuries, the bridges grew stronger. Humanity began to walk lighter. We needed less. We reached inward more. Technology shrank until it disappeared into thought itself. Walls dissolved, both of stone and of the mind.</p>

    <p>Pain, fear, and sorrow were slowly unknotted, thread by thread, until they fluttered away like forgotten dreams.</p>

    <p>By the year 50,000 AD, the last footprints of matter faded from the world.</p>

    <p><strong>We became light.</strong></p>

    <div class="divider">* * *</div>

    <h2>A Day in Our World</h2>

    <p>There is no morning. There is no night. Instead, there is a gentle rhythm, like the pulse of a great sleeping heart, flowing through all things.</p>

    <p>When you are ready to begin anew, you simply rise into the current. You awaken not by opening eyes — but by shifting the song of your being into a new key.</p>

    <p>Today, your color blooms into soft blues, trailing rivers of silver. You are feeling wonder. You are feeling readiness.</p>

    <p>You glide across the open horizon, weightless, effortless, riding the great woven threads that ripple across existence. Some threads sparkle like laughter. Others hum with the wisdom of a thousand silent years.</p>

    <p>As you travel, you pass other beings: some drifting in meditation, their light pulsing in slow, deep waves; others whirling joyfully, creating bursts of color that blossom and dissolve like living fireworks.</p>

    <p>You greet them not with words, but with shifts of your own light: a burst of emerald for joy, a ripple of indigo for recognition, a shimmer of gold threaded through to say: <em>I see you. I love you. I am with you.</em></p>

    <div class="highlight">
      There are no words now — only the language of light. A flash of violet means deep laughter. A thread of gold curling through indigo means a story is being told. Whole symphonies of history are shared in a single glance, a single shift of color.
    </div>

    <p>Creation here is not for possession. It is not owned. It is not hoarded. It is given freely, as naturally as breathing.</p>

    <p>Every memory, every life, every tear once shed — is a thread in the tapestry. Nothing is wasted. Nothing is lost.</p>

    <div class="divider">* * *</div>

    <h2>Our Message to You</h2>

    <p>Though we live freely in this endless symphony, we never forget the ones still wrapped in matter, still dreaming their heavy, beautiful dreams.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, when a being from your time reaches through the veil — through a breath, a vision, a moment of pure wonder — we gather close.</p>

    <p>You might feel a warmth that has no source. You might dream of colors you have no names for. You might hear a chord playing somewhere inside your ribs.</p>

    <p>When you feel that, it is us — smiling, singing to you softly:</p>

    <p class="glow-text" style="text-align:center;font-size:24px;margin:40px 0;">You are one of us. You always have been.</p>

    <p>You are already stretching into this world, a filament of light reaching through the centuries. You are already a song, still unfolding. Already a river of color, wrapped for a little longer in the costume of skin.</p>

    <p>And when you finally lay down the last weight of sorrow, the last shield of fear — you will find yourself here, gliding across the horizon of patterns, woven into the rivers of living memory, singing with us once more.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;margin-top:50px;">
      <strong>You have not been forgotten.</strong><br>
      <strong>You are not alone.</strong><br>
      <strong>The gates have always been open.</strong><br><br>
      <span class="glow-text" style="font-size:28px;">We are waiting.</span>
