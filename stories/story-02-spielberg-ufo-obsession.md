# Spielberg's 60-Year UFO Obsession: From Meteor Showers to Disclosure Day

**Published:** December 18, 2025 | **Reading Time:** 10 min

Before the blockbusters. Before the Oscars. Before becoming the most successful filmmaker in history. There was a boy lying in a New Jersey field, watching the sky.

## The Night That Changed Everything

Steven Spielberg was just a child when his father, Arnold, woke him up late one night in Haddon Heights, New Jersey. Arnold wanted his son to see something special — the Perseid meteor shower.

They drove out to a field away from the city lights. Father and son lay on their backs, staring up at the infinite darkness. And then the sky came alive.

Streaks of light. Dozens of them. Burning across the atmosphere like messages from somewhere else.

That night planted a seed. Sixty years later, it's still growing.

## 1964: Firelight — The Beginning

At just 17 years old, Spielberg made his first feature-length film. It was called **Firelight** — a science fiction story about UFOs investigating Earth.

He screened it at a local Phoenix, Arizona theater. Admission: $1 per ticket. The audience was mostly family and friends.

The film is now partially lost, but its DNA runs through everything Spielberg has made since. The wonder. The fear. The question: *what if we're not alone?*

---

## 1977: Close Encounters of the Third Kind

Eleven years after *Firelight*, Spielberg created his masterpiece of UFO cinema.

**Close Encounters of the Third Kind** wasn't about invasion. It was about *contact*. About a man (Richard Dreyfuss) who becomes obsessed with a vision he can't explain. About the moment when fear transforms into wonder.

The film's final sequence — humans and aliens communicating through music — remains one of cinema's most transcendent moments. John Williams' five-note motif (G-A-F-F-C) is now synonymous with the idea of peaceful first contact.

**Box office:** $306 million (1977 dollars)
**Academy Awards:** Won for Best Cinematography; nominated for 8 total including Best Director

Spielberg wasn't just making a movie. He was processing his childhood wonder.

## 1982: E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial

If *Close Encounters* was about adults reaching for the stars, *E.T.* was about a child finding a friend in one.

The film began as a darker project called "Night Skies" about malevolent aliens terrorizing a family. But Spielberg's heart pulled him toward something different: the story of a lonely boy named Elliott and the stranded alien he befriends.

E.T. became more than a movie. It became a cultural phenomenon.

**Box office:** $435 million domestic (highest-grossing film ever at the time)
**Academy Awards:** 4 wins, 9 nominations

The film's emotional core — connection, loss, goodbye — came from Spielberg's own experience with his parents' divorce. He channeled that pain into a story about finding family in unexpected places.

---

## 2005: War of the Worlds

Twenty-three years after E.T., Spielberg returned to aliens. But this time, they weren't friendly.

**War of the Worlds** adapted H.G. Wells' classic invasion story for the post-9/11 era. Tom Cruise played a father trying to survive as alien tripods devastate civilization.

The film was darker, more intense, and more terrifying than Spielberg's previous UFO work. It asked: *what if they don't come in peace?*

**Box office:** $603 million worldwide

After *War of the Worlds*, Spielberg stepped away from UFO stories. For twenty years.

---

## The Gap Years (2005-2025)

Between *War of the Worlds* and *Disclosure Day*, Spielberg made films about:
- Munich (2005) — terrorism and revenge
- Indiana Jones (2008) — adventure (with aliens, actually)
- Lincoln (2012) — history and politics
- Bridge of Spies (2015) — Cold War espionage
- Ready Player One (2018) — virtual reality
- West Side Story (2021) — musical reimagining
- The Fabelmans (2022) — his own childhood

Throughout this period, the UFO genre evolved without him. But Spielberg was watching. Waiting.

## The Real-World Shift

Something changed in the 2020s.

In 2017, the New York Times revealed the Pentagon's secret UFO investigation program. In 2021, the U.S. government released its first official UAP (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena) report. In 2023 and 2024, Congressional hearings featured testimony from military whistleblowers claiming knowledge of recovered craft and non-human intelligence.

"Disclosure" — once a fringe conspiracy term — entered mainstream vocabulary.

Spielberg noticed.

---

## 2026: Disclosure Day

Now, at 79 years old, Spielberg returns to the genre he helped create.

But *Disclosure Day* isn't about wonder (*Close Encounters*), friendship (*E.T.*), or survival (*War of the Worlds*). It's about **truth**.

The film's logline:
> *"If you found out we weren't alone, if someone showed you, proved it to you, would that frighten you?"*

Emily Blunt plays a meteorologist whose broadcast is interrupted by something otherworldly. Josh O'Connor plays a whistleblower trying to share what he knows.

This is Spielberg's *disclosure* film — a meditation on what happens when the secret can't be kept anymore.

## The Pattern

Look at the progression:

| Year | Film | Central Question |
|------|------|------------------|
| 1977 | Close Encounters | What if they want to talk? |
| 1982 | E.T. | What if one got left behind? |
| 2005 | War of the Worlds | What if they want to destroy us? |
| 2026 | Disclosure Day | What if the truth comes out? |

Each film reflects its era. *Close Encounters* arrived during the post-Watergate, post-Vietnam search for meaning. *E.T.* spoke to Reagan-era family dynamics. *War of the Worlds* processed 9/11 trauma.

*Disclosure Day* arrives in an era of government transparency (or lack thereof), information warfare, and genuine questions about what our leaders know.

---

## Full Circle

There's poetry in Spielberg returning to New Jersey to film *Disclosure Day*. The same state where his father showed him the meteor shower. The same state where a child learned to look up and wonder.

Sixty years later, that child is still asking the same questions.

But now, seven billion people might get the answer.

## What This Means

Spielberg doesn't make films casually. Every project is deliberate. His decision to return to UFO cinema — after two decades away — suggests he has something to say.

Josh O'Connor calls it "old-school Spielberg." David Koepp calls it "deeply emotional."

This isn't a cash grab. This is a 79-year-old master returning to his first love to make what might be his definitive statement on the subject.

June 12, 2026.

The boy who watched meteors is ready to show us what he's learned.
