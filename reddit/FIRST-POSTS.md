## POST 3: Spielberg's UFO Legacy

**Title:** Spielberg's UFO Films: How Disclosure Day Fits the Legacy

**Body:**
```
Steven Spielberg has been making UFO films for nearly 50 years:

| Year | Film | Theme |
|------|------|-------|
| 1977 | Close Encounters of the Third Kind | Wonder, first contact |
| 1982 | E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial | Friendship, loss |
| 2005 | War of the Worlds | Invasion, survival |
| 2026 | Disclosure Day | Revelation, truth |

**The Pattern:**
- Close Encounters asked: "What if they want to talk?"
- E.T. asked: "What if one got left behind?"
- War of the Worlds asked: "What if they want to destroy us?"
- Disclosure Day asks: "What if the truth comes out?"

Each film reflects its era. Disclosure Day arrives during real-world UAP hearings and government transparency debates.

**Fun fact:** Spielberg's UFO fascination started as a child in New Jersey, when his father woke him up to watch the Perseid meteor shower.

How do you think Disclosure Day will compare to his previous UFO films?

## POST 5: John Williams Discussion

**Title:** John Williams came out of retirement at 93 for this film 🎵

**Body:**
```
Let that sink in.

John Williams — the man who scored Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, and Harry Potter — said he was retiring.

Then Steven called.

This will be Williams' **30th collaboration** with Spielberg.

His previous alien film scores:
- **Close Encounters** — The iconic five-note communication motif
- **E.T.** — One of the most emotional scores ever written

**Questions:**
- Do you think he'll create a new iconic motif for Disclosure Day?
- Will there be any callbacks to Close Encounters?
- What's your favorite Williams/Spielberg score?

The score alone might be worth the ticket price.
