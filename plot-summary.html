    <div class="tagline">"The truth belongs to seven billion people."</div>

    <h2>Plot Overview</h2>

    <p><strong>Disclosure Day</strong> is Steven Spielberg's 2026 science fiction film about humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial life. The film explores what happens when the existence of alien visitors can no longer be hidden from the public.</p>

    <p>The story centers on a <strong>Kansas City weather woman</strong> (Emily Blunt), a local TV meteorologist who detects an anomalous signal while monitoring weather patterns. This discovery sets off a chain of events that will change humanity forever.</p>

    <div class="spoiler-warning">
      <span>⚠️</span>
      <div><strong>Note:</strong> The full plot has not been revealed. This summary is based on the official trailer, press materials, and confirmed details.</div>

        <h4>Kansas City Weather Woman (Emily Blunt)</h4>
        <p>A local TV meteorologist who becomes humanity's first point of contact. In the trailer's most striking moment, she speaks in an alien voice—clicking sounds that suggest the visitors have chosen her as their vessel for communication.</p>
      </div>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="character-box">

      <div class="character-info">
        <h4>Director Harold Kane (Colin Firth)</h4>

    <h2>What We Know About The Story</h2>

    <div class="plot-card">
      <h3>The Discovery</h3>
      <p>Emily Blunt's character, a Kansas City weather woman, detects an unusual signal while working. This signal doesn't match any known natural or man-made pattern. When she investigates, she makes contact with something beyond human understanding.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="plot-card">
      <h3>The Possession/Communication</h3>
      <p>After her discovery, Sarah begins changing. She speaks in clicking sounds and unknown languages. Her eyes display strange patterns. Whether she's being possessed or has become a willing translator for the visitors remains unclear.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="plot-card">
      <h3>The Cover-Up</h3>
      <p>The government has known about extraterrestrial contact for years. Journalist Ethan Hale (Josh O'Connor) discovers the extent of the cover-up and must decide how to expose the truth to "seven billion people."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="plot-card">
      <h3>The Disclosure</h3>
      <p>The film's title suggests that the secret eventually comes out. How humanity reacts to learning they're not alone—and that their governments have hidden this truth—forms the emotional core of the story.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Themes & Ideas</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Truth vs. Secrecy</strong> - Should the public know about extraterrestrial contact?</li>
      <li><strong>Communication</strong> - How do we talk to beings completely unlike us?</li>
      <li><strong>Trust</strong> - In government, in each other, in the visitors themselves</li>
      <li><strong>Transformation</strong> - How contact changes individuals and humanity</li>
      <li><strong>Fear vs. Wonder</strong> - The dual reactions to the unknown</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The "Seven Billion" Mystery</h2>

    <p>One line from the trailer has sparked intense speculation: Josh O'Connor's character says "seven billion" in reference to the people of Earth. But Earth's population is over 8 billion.</p>

    <div class="theory-box">
      <strong>Fan Theory:</strong> The discrepancy has led to theories that not everyone on Earth is human—that some among us are already "visitors" who have been here for years.
    </div>

    <h2>Real-World Connections</h2>

    <p>Disclosure Day arrives at a time when real-world UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) disclosure is happening:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Congressional hearings on UAPs have occurred since 2022</li>
      <li>Military whistleblowers have testified about non-human intelligence</li>
      <li>The Pentagon has acknowledged videos of unexplained craft</li>
      <li>NASA has established UAP study programs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While Disclosure Day is fiction, it taps into the real cultural moment of potential disclosure happening in our world.</p>
